Note
1. This app runs with data from an endpoint and requires network connection to perform operations like:
	*Signup and login
	*Shop products and Add to cart
	*All admin functions(Creating products, users, editing and deleting those too)
2. Only the icons/elements highlighted in blue have full or near-full functionalities
3. All pages are linked to each other and you do not have to open them as individual pages. for example, one you 	open the index file, from there you can navigate the full app. You don't have to open other pages 	individually except the admin folder.
4. The admin page allows you to create products and users, edit and delete products and users. Due to API incompatibility, you would not be able to edit products but you can simply delete and recreate. Users can be edited and deleted
